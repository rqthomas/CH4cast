# CH4cast
Methane ebullition forecasts using FLARE water temperature forecasts in Falling Creek Reservoir VA, USA

Welcome to CH4cast! Below, you will find instructions how to execute CH4cast and generate CH4 ebulliiton rate forecasts in Falling Creek Reservoir, USA. 

First - a few things to note. 

THESE FORECASTS ARE ONLY FOR THE UPSTREAM TRANSECT IN FALLING CREEK RESERVOIR!
CH4cast currently cannot be scaled and run in another freshwater ecosystem. However, we are currently working on adapting a mechanisitic model (HIMELLI) to be run through a similar framework so it can be scalable to more systems and to shorter time scales. 

OK - Here is how to run CH4cast!
